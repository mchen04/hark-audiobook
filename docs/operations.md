## Deployment shape

- Next.js (`pnpm build && pnpm start`, or Vercel) behind HTTPS. The service
  worker and installability require a secure origin (localhost counts for
  development). Application instances are stateless; sessions, metadata, and
  auth attempt budgets are shared through Postgres.
- Set `BETTER_AUTH_URL` to the public origin; mutation requests from any other
  origin are rejected.
- The server stores metadata only; audio bytes live in each device's browser
  storage. There is no object storage to provision.
- Auth rate limiting uses an app-owned atomic database adapter over the
  `rate_limit` table, so cold starts and multiple instances share one
  per-IP/path attempt budget. Its cleanup retention is derived from every
  configured rule (currently ten minutes); Better Auth 1.6's built-in database
  cleanup omits custom-rule windows and must not replace it.
- Session validation is authoritative against Postgres so password resets and
  explicit revocations take effect immediately on every API route.
- Postgres: Vercel runs `pnpm db:migrate` before its production build. Preview
  builds use inert validation-only environment placeholders and never connect to
  or migrate the production database. On other hosts, run migrations before
  starting a new build. Migrations are ordered, idempotent, and verified to apply
  from an empty database. The app never mutates schema at runtime.
- Email: set both `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` to enable password resets in
  production; reset requests fail closed when delivery is not configured.
  Development captures expire after one hour in `.data/mail/`. Reset tokens
  are single-use, expire in 30 minutes, and revoke other sessions on success.
- Rotate the development Neon credential before any public deployment.

## Backup and restore

- **Database**: Neon branch snapshots or `pg_dump`. All server-side state
  lives in Postgres; a database restore is a full server restore.
- **Audio**: the MP3 files are the user's own — the app never holds the only
  copy. After any restore (or on a new device), opening a book prompts for the
  original file and verifies it by size and fingerprint before attaching.
- Browser storage can be evicted by the OS under pressure; the original files
  remain the durable copy. The app requests persistent storage at import.
- The v2 media store splits audiobooks into 4 MiB cache entries so iPhone
  playback never has to materialize a whole audiobook in one WebKit process.
  Downloads made by the older whole-file store require attaching the original
  MP3 once after this upgrade; server metadata, position, and playback history remain.

The checked-in `drizzle/meta/*.json` files are migration-generation state, not
database backups. Keep the complete snapshot chain with its SQL migrations;
restore live data from Neon snapshots or `pg_dump`, never from Drizzle metadata.

## Data lifecycle

- Book deletion: the rows cascade server-side and the client removes the
  device-local bytes in the same flow.
- Account deletion: requires the email and current password, then journals a
  short-lived deletion intent on the device. The device purge completes before
  the idempotent server commit cascades every row and expires the cookie. A
  crash or lost success response resumes from that journal, so a deleted
  account cannot leave its local mirror behind.
- Export: `GET /api/account/export` returns all metadata, chapters, progress,
  playback history, legacy saved positions, collections, tags, sessions, and preferences as JSON.
  Audio bytes are the user's own files and are not duplicated.

## Known platform limitations

- iOS Safari installs PWAs via Share → Add to Home Screen; there is no install
  prompt event, and background audio controls are more limited than Chromium's
  Media Session surface. Run the automated WebKit gate and the physical-device
  release checklist in `docs/ios-pwa-testing.md` before shipping changes to
  authentication, imports, storage, service workers, or playback.
- Media Session action support varies by browser; unsupported actions are
  feature-detected and skipped without affecting playback.
- Browsers may evict Cache Storage under storage pressure; the app requests
  persistent storage when importing, clears stale download metadata when the
  matching media entry is gone, and surfaces an original-file reattach flow
  instead of pretending the book is playable.
- Playback actions are written to IndexedDB first and replayed after reconnect;
  both local and server stores retain only the newest 50 actions per audiobook.
- `chapterline:active-user` is observed across tabs. Completing sign-out in one
  tab revokes peer shells, stops their player, and redirects them to `/login`;
  the parity gate waits beyond a heartbeat and proves no departed-account data
  is recreated.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stale UI after deploy**: the service worker takes over on the next
  navigation (skipWaiting + clients.claim). A shell refresh promotes the new
  document only after all of its hashed chunks are cached, so a transient chunk
  failure keeps the previous working shell. If a development client sees a
  chunk 404 after `.next` was replaced under a running server, restart that
  server and reload once.
- **Import fails with "not a valid MP3"**: the file must be a real MPEG
  Layer 3 file; renamed non-MP3s are rejected by the in-browser parser.
- **"This device does not have enough free storage"**: the import is bounded
  by browser storage quota — free space or use a device with more room.
- **A book shows "Attach MP3" on another device**: expected — audio bytes
  never sync; attach the original file once per device.
- **Progress seems stuck on one device**: check the response of a manual
  progress PATCH — a 409 `stale-event` means another device has fresher state,
  which is the deterministic conflict rule working as intended.
- **Password reset mails**: in development they land in `.data/mail/` as JSON
  files containing the reset URL.
