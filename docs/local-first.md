# Local-first architecture

Last reviewed against the implementation: 2026-07-28

Hark's library reads from the device, always. The network only syncs in the
background. There is no "am I online?" branch anywhere on the read path.

This note is the design contract. It was written before the sync engine, because
designing a sync engine in code first is how local-first projects lose data.

## 1. Why this is a completion, not a reversal

The book content already never leaves the device (`src/lib/local-import.ts` parses
MP3s and `src/lib/document-import/` extracts and narrates documents in the browser;
`src/app/api/books/local/route.ts` receives metadata only;
`media_assets` has no storage key or URL column). The device therefore already
holds the only copy of the only irreplaceable data. Postgres holds metadata that
could be rebuilt from it. Making the device authoritative for reads finishes an
architecture that was already half-built.

## 2. What is mirrored, and what is not

Mirrored to IndexedDB (the app reads these locally and only locally):

| Entity                    | Local store         | Sync unit             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| books                     | `books`             | book aggregate        |
| chapters                  | `chapters`          | book aggregate        |
| media asset metadata      | `books` (embedded)  | book aggregate        |
| playback states           | `playbackStates`    | per book+device       |
| tags (vocabulary)         | `tags`              | user-level, full pull |
| book↔tag edges            | `bookTags`          | book aggregate        |
| collections               | `collections`       | user-level, full pull |
| collection↔book edges     | `collectionBooks`   | collection aggregate  |
| user preferences          | `preferences`       | user-level, LWW       |
| recent listening sessions | `listeningSessions` | append-only           |

Never mirrored — these stay server-authoritative:

- `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, `rate_limit`. Sessions must stay
  server-authoritative; a device may not mint its own auth.
- `playback_action_receipts`. That is the server's idempotency ledger and only
  the server may write it.

Never moved to the server, ever: **audio bytes, source-document bytes, and transcript payloads**. They
live in Cache Storage / IndexedDB on the device that imported them, and there is
no route capable of accepting or serving them. This is a hard boundary, not a
default.

## 3. The sync unit is the book aggregate

`books`, `mediaAssets`, `collections`, `playbackStates` and `userPreferences`
carry `updatedAt`. `chapters`, `tags`, `bookTags`, `collectionBooks` and
`listeningSessions` do not.

Rather than add five columns and backfill them, the **book aggregate** is the
unit of change: any mutation to a book's chapters or tag edges bumps that book's
`books.updatedAt`. A pull that sees a changed book re-pulls that book's chapters
and tag edges wholesale. The same rule applies to a collection and its
membership edges.

This is deliberate. It makes the cursor trivially correct, keeps conflict
resolution reasoning at one granularity, and avoids a partially-applied child
row ever being visible without its parent.

Consequence that must be honored by every write path: **a mutation that only
touches a child table must still bump the parent's `updatedAt`**, or the change
will never propagate to another device. Any new mutation route that forgets this
is a sync bug, and the two-device convergence test exists to catch it.

That consequence is load-bearing for **books** and, today, only for books. Book
aggregates are cursored, so `books.updatedAt` is the only thing that puts a
chapter or tag-edge change into another device's incremental pull. Collections
are pulled in full and uncursored, so a missing `collections.updatedAt` bump does
not currently break propagation — which means propagation cannot be used as
evidence that the bump happened. Assert the timestamp directly. A test that
infers the bump from "the other device saw it" passes even when the bump is gone,
and would stop protecting anything the moment collections became cursored.

Tag vocabulary and collection lists are small and user-level, so they are pulled
in full on every sync rather than cursored.

## 4. Local schema

Two IndexedDB databases, kept separate on purpose: state and outbox have
different failure modes, and merging them would mean migrating both at once.

### `chapterline-offline-v1` — device state, version 6 → 7

Existing stores are untouched and keep their data: `downloads`, `transcripts`,
`deletions`, `cacheEntries`.

Version 7 adds the mirror:

- `books` — key `userId:bookId`, indexes `by-user`, `by-user-updated`
- `chapters` — key `userId:bookId:paddedIndex`, index `by-user-book`
- `playbackStates` — key `userId:bookId`, index `by-user`
- `tags` — key `userId:tagId`, index `by-user`
- `bookTags` — key `userId:bookId:tagId`, indexes `by-user`, `by-user-book`
- `collections` — key `userId:collectionId`, index `by-user`
- `collectionBooks` — key `userId:collectionId:bookId`, indexes `by-user`,
  `by-user-collection`
- `preferences` — key `userId`
- `listeningSessions` — key `userId:sessionId`, index `by-user-book`
- `syncMeta` — key `userId`, holds the pull cursor and last-sync time

Every store is keyed by `userId` first and carries a `by-user` index. That is
what makes account-switch purge a bounded, provable operation rather than a
best-effort sweep.

The version-7 upgrade is **additive only**. It creates stores; it does not
rewrite or delete existing records. A device that already holds downloads,
transcripts and a pending deletion journal comes through with all of it intact,
and the mirror simply starts empty and fills on first pull.

#### Upgrade steps must be awaited

One cursor sweep is still fire-and-forget:

- `offline/db.ts` — `void downloads.openCursor().then(...)` (the legacy-bookmark
  strip)

The `void` means a rejection inside the sweep becomes an unhandled rejection
instead of aborting the version-change transaction. The new version number still
commits, and because the sweep is guarded by `oldVersion < N` it can never run
again. The outbox's sweeps in `offline-sync/db.ts` are awaited — the v4 step
rewrites rows and says so in place.

Today the fire-and-forget sweep only _deletes_ legacy rows, so a silent partial
sweep leaves stale-but-harmless data. That stops being true the moment an upgrade **rewrites**
data. Any new upgrade step must be `await`ed inside `upgrade()` before the
version is bumped, so a failure aborts the transaction and the upgrade is retried
rather than half-committed. Copying the existing `void` pattern into a
data-rewriting migration is how this design would lose user data.

### `chapterline-sync-v1` — the outbox, version 3 → 4

Today `mutations` holds only `kind: "progress"`. Version 4 generalizes it to
every mirrored mutation. `sequences` (per-book device high-water marks) is
unchanged and must never be reset — those values order replay, and losing them
loses writes.

## 5. The outbox

Record shape:

```
{
  key:         string,   // dedupe/coalesce identity, see below
  userId:      string,
  kind:        "progress" | "import" | "metadata" | "tag" | "collection"
             | "archive" | "delete" | "history",
  entityId:    string,   // bookId / collectionId
  payload:     object,   // the intended change
  mutationId:  string,   // uuid, the idempotency key sent to the server
  deviceId:    string,
  deviceSequence: number,
  queuedAt:    number,
  attempts:    number,
}
```

Rules:

1. **Journal intent before acting.** The outbox row is written **first**, and the
   optimistic mirror update only after it. Each half is individually atomic.

   An earlier draft of this note required both in one IndexedDB transaction.
   That is not implementable: the outbox lives in `chapterline-sync-v1` and the
   mirror in `chapterline-offline-v1`, IndexedDB has no cross-database
   transaction, and section 4 keeps the two databases separate on purpose.

   Ordering carries the guarantee instead, and it is the same ordering
   `deletion-journal.ts` already proves. A crash between the two halves leaves
   an outbox row whose local projection has not been applied — recoverable, and
   the server still learns about the write. The forbidden state is the reverse:
   a mirrored change the user can see with no queued write behind it, which
   would be a silent lost write. Never write the mirror first.

   Imports use the same order, but their projection is explicit rather than a
   generic mutation patch: queue the registration, resolve whether its
   device-minted id remains local or maps to a canonical server id, then write
   that book and its chapters to the mirror. This makes a new offline import
   immediately routable at `/books/:id` without creating a phantom row when an
   online duplicate resolves to another id.

2. **Idempotent on replay.** `mutationId` is generated once, at queue time, and
   reused on every retry. The server dedupes on it. Replaying a mutation the
   server already applied is a no-op, not a double-apply.
3. **Coalescing is by `key`, and only where it is safe.** Progress for a given
   book+device coalesces to the highest `deviceSequence` (existing behavior).
   Tag and collection edge changes coalesce per edge. Renames coalesce per book.
   `import`, `delete` and `history` **never** coalesce — each is a distinct
   event and dropping one loses a write.
4. **Retry on reconnect and on launch, never in the background.** iOS does not
   support Background Sync and will not wake a closed PWA. The queue drains when
   the app is open. No UI may imply otherwise.
5. **Failure classification is inherited**, not reinvented:
   `isRetryableMutationStatus` and `shouldRetainMutation` in
   `offline-sync/replay.ts`
   already encode it. 401/403 retain (the session may come back). 4xx other than
   409 is terminal. 409 goes to conflict reconciliation.

### 5.4 A delete supersedes an unsent registration of the same rendition

The outbox drains in key order with several rows in flight, which is NOT the
order the user expressed their intents. `delete` sorts before `import`, so a
delete could land, release the fingerprint, and let a registration queued
_earlier_ find the fingerprint free and re-create the book the user had already
deleted. The fuzz found this on seed 20260105 and called it what it is: a
resurrection. Nothing was lost in transit — the delete was undone by an intent
the user had already superseded.

So `commitBookDeletion` drops any unsent registration of the same source and
rendition, in the same transaction that journals the delete: no window in which
both rows exist, and no ordering left to get right. It links them two ways,
because a user can be looking at either kind of row — by book id (a device-only
book, normally in the mirror and always in `downloads`) and by the
fingerprint/rendition tuple (read from the mirror, never sent on the wire).
Fingerprint alone is not enough: deleting rendition A must not erase a queued
replacement B. When a book route already knows the tuple but the mirror row is
unavailable, that route carries both values into the delete. A registration
queued _after_ a delete is kept: re-importing something you deleted is a new
intent, not a stale one.

### 5.5 When the server renames a book mid-flight

A registration queued offline carries the id this device minted. If the server
already owns that fingerprint it answers 409 with the canonical id, and the local
identity moves onto it (§10). Two consequences that are easy to miss, and both
were bugs:

- **Queued rows naming the abandoned id must be re-addressed too**, with the
  production key builders rather than hand-built strings, or every edit, tag,
  archive and delete queued before the merge replays against a book the server
  has never heard of and settles as terminal. Progress is re-stamped from the
  _target's_ sequence counter, because the server discards a sequence at or below
  its high-water mark for (user, book, device) **and answers 200** — a carried-over
  sequence is a write that reports success and vanishes.
- **The local identity moves as one aggregate**, not just the audio record.
  The device-minted mirror book, chapters, playback state, tag and collection
  edges, and listening sessions move or merge onto the canonical id. The
  abandoned mirror row is removed before the registration settles, so an
  offline deep link cannot outlive the id the server rejected.
- **A 404 is not terminal while a registration for that book is still queued.**
  `archive`, `collection`, `delete` and `history` all sort ahead of `import`, so
  they reach the server before the merge is knowable. Dropping them there loses
  the user's intent, including their delete.

### 5.6 Preferences are the one write that is not an outbox row

`savePreferences` keeps its pending revision in the localStorage envelope rather
than the outbox. It is still journalled, drained and reported — the sign-out
drain enumerates it alongside the outbox and the playback queue, and reports it
if the server will not take it — but the mechanism differs, and this note would
be lying if it claimed otherwise. Moving it onto a real outbox kind is the
cleaner end state.

## 6. Pull

`GET /api/sync/pull?since=<iso>` returns everything that changed for the signed-in
user since the cursor, as the book/collection aggregates of section 3, plus the
full tag vocabulary, collection list, preferences, and recent listening sessions.

It reuses the query shape already proven in
`src/server/account/export-stream.ts`, which reads exactly this set of tables
under a read-only repeatable-read transaction.

- Cursor is `max(updatedAt)` observed in the response, stored in `syncMeta`.
- The cursor is advanced **only after** the whole batch has been committed to
  IndexedDB, so an interrupted pull re-fetches rather than skips.
- Deletions are conveyed as explicit tombstones, not absence. Absence cannot be
  distinguished from "not in this page".
- A new index on `books (owner_id, updated_at, id)` ships as a drizzle migration
  to keep the cursor scan cheap.

Pull runs on launch (after paint, never before) and on reconnect.

## 7. Conflict resolution — extend, do not replace

The repo already has a working model and this design adds no second one:

- `playback_states` carries `deviceId`, `deviceSequence`, `eventOccurredAt`;
  `playback_device_sequences` holds per-device high-water marks;
  `playback_action_receipts` is the durable idempotency ledger.
- `src/server/playback/progress-policy.ts` and `listening-session-policy.ts`
  hold the rules. `PROGRESS_CONFLICT_EVENT` already surfaces conflicts to the UI.
- Immediately before replay, a progress row is compared with the complete
  durable local tuple. Position, playback rate, and completion are separate
  last-writer-wins registers: `eventOccurredAt` clocks the position,
  `playbackRateOccurredAt` clocks the rate, and `completedOccurredAt` clocks the
  completion flag. Replay folds in only the fields whose local clocks are
  newer, then gives the replacement a fresh device sequence. A late stale-tab
  flush can therefore carry a real rate change without moving the position or
  changing completion.
- `stateOccurredAt` remains a combined rate/completion clock for rows and
  clients from before the split. Nullable per-field database columns fall back
  to it during migration. A legacy input that supplies only this one clock is
  necessarily still a tuple: the server cannot distinguish a rate-only write
  from an intentional restart, so guessing would silently discard one of those
  valid legacy operations. New clients always send both independent clocks.
- Player bootstrap chooses the freshest local/server value for each register
  independently and hydrates the selected tuple with its original clocks.
  Position cadence therefore advances only the position clock; merely carrying
  an unchanged rate or completion value never claims that it changed now.
- In `localStorage`, each document writes per-field registers under its own
  writer id and reads the newest clock across writers. A rate-only tab therefore
  never replaces another tab's position key, even if their reads and writes
  interleave. The joined `chapterline:position:*` tuple remains for older builds
  and diagnostics, but is no longer the sole durable authority.
- The one queued progress row per book/device field-merges before replacement;
  the highest device sequence is only its replay envelope. Any merged payload
  receives a new mutation id so an acknowledgement already in flight cannot
  settle a field that arrived after the request began.
- During a rolling deploy, a `400` from a predecessor server that does not know
  the per-field keys retains the v2 event unchanged. It is retried after rollout
  instead of being downgraded to the ambiguous legacy combined tuple.

Per entity:

| Entity                                  | Rule                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playback state                          | per-device sequence idempotency plus independent LWW clocks for position, rate, and completion                                |
| listening sessions                      | append-only, dedupe by id; existing session policy                                                                            |
| book metadata (title, author, archived) | last-writer-wins on `updatedAt`, ties broken by `deviceId`                                                                    |
| tag / collection edges                  | add-wins; an explicit remove carries a tombstone that outranks a concurrent add only when its `updatedAt` is newer            |
| preferences                             | last-writer-wins on `updatedAt`                                                                                               |
| import (new book)                       | fingerprint-unique; a duplicate registration returns 409 with `existingBookId` and is treated as a merge, never a second book |

Conflicts are surfaced through the existing `PROGRESS_CONFLICT_EVENT`
mechanism rather than a parallel channel.

## 8. The launch path

The whole point. Warm launch must paint real library content without touching
the network, so that a 3000ms cold database and airplane mode produce the same
number as wifi.

Icon tap → painted content:

0. The install handler declares a **static route** for the manifest's
   `start_url` (`/library?source=pwa`), so the browser answers that one
   navigation straight from Cache Storage **without starting the service worker
   at all**. This exists because booting a worker to ask it about a navigation
   makes Chromium hedge the wait by speculatively fetching the same document:
   the paint never waits for it, but the server renders `/library` and runs its
   queries on every cold launch and the answer is discarded.

   Two details are load-bearing, because a routing **miss goes to the network**
   rather than falling back to the `fetch` handler. The condition matches the
   start_url exactly — pathname _and_ search — so every other navigation is left
   to `serveNavigation`, which is not query-sensitive; and `precacheShell`
   stores the shell under that exact key so the lookup hits. Writing the rule
   for a bare `/library` put the whole launch document back on the wire
   (measured: 5.4 KB per launch, cold-database p95 3426ms). `addRoutes` is
   Chromium-only and guarded; elsewhere step 1 is unchanged and authoritative.

1. The service worker serves the `/library` document **from Cache Storage,
   cache-first**. No network on the critical path, so no network profile can
   change this step's cost.
2. That cached document is a **user-agnostic shell**. It contains no book data
   and no user identity — which is what makes caching it safe across accounts.
   The server page therefore renders no user rows into HTML.
3. The client reads the mirror from IndexedDB and renders real book cards.
   `data-launch-ready` is set at this point, and **only** when real content or
   the genuine empty state is on screen — never when a skeleton mounts.
   A cached `/books/:id` route also waits for that first device snapshot before
   treating the temporary empty map as a miss. Once a book is active, unload
   events are scoped by account and book id, so deleting some other missing
   book cannot stop it.
4. _After_ paint, revalidation runs: session check and `GET /api/sync/pull`.
   Results patch into the already-rendered list in place — no flash, no layout
   jump, no scroll reset.

Session handling under a cached shell:

- The cached shell is served without consulting the server, so `requireSession()`
  does not run on a warm launch. That is intended: it is what removes Postgres
  from the paint path.
- The client checks `ACTIVE_USER_KEY` before rendering the mirror. No active
  user → `/login`.
- Revalidation answering 401/403 → `/login`, **without purging**. An expired or
  revoked session must never strand the user on a cached library.

  An earlier draft of this note said "purge and `/login`". That would have been a
  data-loss bug: the purge path deletes downloads and their media, and per
  section 10 those MP3s exist nowhere else. A session timing out overnight is a
  routine event, and it must not cost the user every audiobook on the device.

  Privacy is still closed, one step later and by the right mechanism: the mirror
  that survives belongs to the account that is still signed in on this device,
  and section 11's sign-in purge removes every _other_ account's data before a
  different user can see anything. Expiry is not a trust boundary; a new sign-in
  is.

Consequences that must hold:

- **Zero Postgres queries on the warm-launch critical paint path.** Proven by a
  query counter around the postgres client, not by argument. The benchmark also
  asserts zero server document requests of any kind during a launch, which is
  stricter: it catches a request the paint does not wait for but the server
  still pays for, which is exactly how the speculative preload above was found.
- **The launch must paint the user's real library, not merely something.** The
  benchmark asserts the readiness marker says `books`, counts the rendered
  cards, and requires the document to arrive as `cache-storage` with an empty
  transfer. Without that last part a device whose mirror had been evicted
  painted "Bring your first audiobook" to an account owning 1000 books and
  scored the best numbers ever recorded.
- First install has no cache, so it must race the network against a bounded
  timeout rather than hanging on a fetch that a weak-but-alive connection will
  never reject. The current unbounded `fetch(request).catch(...)` is exactly the
  bug that produces a blank screen instead of a fallback.
- `use-library-books.ts` currently skips fetching on first render. Once the
  first paint comes from local data, that skip is a correctness bug and the
  revalidation must exist.

### 8.1 Offline import needs its code cached, not just its data

The import path reaches its MP3 parser through `await import("music-metadata")`,
that package reaches the parser that does the work through a SECOND dynamic
import which only runs when something is actually parsed, the hasher is a third,
and the fingerprint runs in a **Worker** whose script no `import()` can reach at
all. A code-split chunk is not referenced by the cached shell, so `precacheShell`
never sees it, and the service worker's runtime caching only stores what has
actually been requested — which is never, until someone picks a file.

The consequence was that importing a book with no network had never worked: it
failed with "Failed to load chunk" where the audiobook should have been, which
also made §10's eviction recovery unreachable exactly when it is needed. So:

- `pwa-register.tsx` warms the parser after paint by parsing a synthesized
  MPEG-1 Layer 3 frame through the real `parseBlob`, so whatever chunk an MP3
  needs is the chunk that gets fetched, with no assumption about the package's
  internals. It marks `data-import-ready` when that and the hasher have resolved,
  in the same spirit as `data-launch-ready` — otherwise the state is invisible
  and a test can only guess at it with a sleep.
- The Worker cannot be warmed, so `fingerprintMedia` falls back to hashing
  inline when its script will not load. Slower, and better than being unable to
  add a book.

Anything new on a path that must work offline gets the same audit: every
`await import(` and every `new Worker(` is a network dependency until proven
otherwise. The production build therefore emits a checked dependency-closure
manifest for document adapters, Kestrel, ONNX, MP3 encoding, and the shared
Turbopack worker bootstrap. Shell promotion caches that manifest's files as one
generation; after the exact model marker exists it carries the pinned ONNX
Runtime module and WASM forward too.

## 9. One library UI

`/library` is the only library UI. "On this device" becomes a facet alongside
the existing status filters, not a second screen. `/offline` redirects into the
unified library.

- Books whose audio is not on this device stay browsable, searchable, taggable
  and sortable. They are visibly marked and never look playable.
- Every capability of the old Downloads screen survives in the merged view,
  including byte size and removing a download.
- Search, status filters, tag filters, sort, view toggle and the continue card
  all operate on local data, so they work identically with the network off.

## 10. Eviction and storage pressure

Safari reclaims script-writable storage from disused origins.
`navigator.storage.persist()` is the mitigation and
`src/lib/offline/media-store.ts` already requests persistence, checks
`navigator.storage.estimate()`, and handles `QuotaExceededError`. The mirror
reuses that machinery rather than bypassing it.

Two different losses, two different recoveries:

- **Mirror evicted** — recoverable. Metadata re-pulls from Postgres. The app
  detects the empty mirror, re-pulls, and carries on.
- **Audio evicted** — _not_ recoverable from anywhere. The MP3 exists only on
  this device (section 2). The app must detect it, keep the book visible with
  its metadata intact, never let it look playable, and say plainly that the file
  must be re-imported.

Re-import must be cheap and lossless, and the machinery already exists: media is
fingerprinted with sha256, `media_assets` is unique on
(owner, fingerprintKind, fingerprint), and duplicate registration returns 409
with `existingBookId` plus the saved position, which `local-import.ts` already
follows. Re-importing an evicted book must reconnect to the **same** book and
restore progress, chapters, tags and collections — never create a duplicate,
never reset the position.

Storing the file's path cannot rescue this: `<input type="file">` yields a
`File`, never a path, and File System Access is unavailable in Safari on iOS.
Re-picking the file is the only recovery, which is why it must be lossless.
The cold offline `/books/:id` route reads this metadata directly from the
mirror, independent of the current library filters, and renders the attach gate
even when the MP3 is absent. A player URL must never fall through to a library
grid whose header and mini-player disagree with the route.

## 11. Account lifecycle

A cached page, mirrored row, or downloaded file from one account must never be
readable by another.

Purge runs on **both** sign-out and sign-in, and covers: every mirror store by
`by-user` index, the outbox, Cache Storage entries for pages and media,
localStorage keys for that user, and `ACTIVE_USER_KEY`. Purging on sign-in as
well as sign-out is what protects against a crash between the two.

`ACTIVE_USER_KEY` is also a cross-tab revocation boundary. Every mounted shell
subscribes to its storage changes (plus a same-document event); removing it
unmounts the account's providers, stops playback, and redirects the peer tab to
`/login`. A stale server-rendered `userId` may bootstrap the device once, but it
must never override a later removal from browser storage.

The two purges have deliberately different targets:

- **Sign-out** purges the account that is leaving.
- **Sign-in** purges every account _other_ than the one signing in — never the
  incoming account's own data.

Sign-out drains queued writes first, then installs an origin-wide write fence
before the auth request leaves. The fence cancels document narration and media
writes in every tab; those operations share an account lock with purge, so the
sweep cannot snapshot around a writer or wait for hours of uncancelled speech.
After the lock drains, purge verifies that no account-indexed row was recreated
and repeats the sweep once if a write already in flight crossed the boundary.
An unconfirmed request fence may age out if its document dies, but a successful
sign-out or a started purge commits the fence so it cannot expire mid-sweep.
The committed form contains no account identity and blocks writes globally
until an authenticated sign-in waits behind the global purge lock. A failed
sign-out clears its still-pending, account-scoped fence immediately.

That asymmetry is load-bearing. Purging the incoming account's own data on every
login would delete its downloaded audio, and per section 1 those MP3s exist
nowhere else in the world — the server has never held the bytes. Wiping every
other account still delivers the property this section exists for (B can never
read A's rows, because the next sign-in finishes any cleanup a crash
interrupted) without destroying the only copy of something irreplaceable.

The cached shell is user-agnostic and holds no user data, so it may survive an
account switch. Every store that does hold user data is keyed by `userId`, which
is what makes the purge provable rather than best-effort.

Account deletion adds a durable two-phase boundary. Password verification first
issues a short-lived bearer intent. The browser journals it, runs the complete
local purge without revoking the still-needed session, records that the purge
finished, and only then makes an idempotent server commit. The consumed token is
kept briefly as a deletion receipt, so retrying after a lost HTTP response still
returns success. A root-level runner resumes either the purge or commit after a
tab crash; server deletion is never allowed to outrun an incomplete device
purge.

## 12. Migration for devices that already have data

Non-negotiable: a device that already holds downloads, transcripts and a pending
deletion journal must come through the upgrade with all of it intact.

- The version-7 upgrade is additive; it creates stores and rewrites nothing.
- Existing `downloads` records remain the source of truth for "audio is on this
  device" and are joined to mirrored books by `bookId`.
- The first pull after upgrade populates the mirror. Until it completes, the
  library renders from `downloads` alone, so an offline device that upgrades
  still shows its books.
- The deletion journal keeps retrying on next load, unchanged.

## 13. What this design deliberately does not do

- No CRDTs or operational transform. The existing last-writer-wins model with
  device sequences and idempotency receipts is extended instead.
- No real-time sync, websockets or push. Launch, reconnect, and post-mutation is
  enough.
- No Background Sync / Periodic Background Sync — iOS support is poor and the
  deletion-journal retry-on-next-load pattern is the precedent.
- No audio on the server, and no object storage. This reverses the privacy
  promise and is out of scope.
- No SQLite-WASM. A megabyte of WASM instantiating before the first book can be
  read fights the sub-500ms bar; iOS restricts OPFS sync access to Workers; and
  a few hundred books filter in JavaScript in well under a millisecond.

## 14. Residual risks

- **Staleness.** The library can be up to one sync interval behind another
  device. That is the explicit trade for network-independent launch.
- **Queue drains only while the app is open.** A mutation made offline reaches
  the server on the next foregrounded launch or reconnect, not before. No UI may
  imply background delivery.
- **Evicted audio is unrecoverable** without a re-import, by design.
