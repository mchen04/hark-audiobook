/**
 * The MINIMUM GAP between two cadence-driven durable local writes — and, since
 * the timer below offers one every time it fires, also the cadence itself.
 *
 * TWO SOURCES, ONE GATE. The durable position is offered by both a timer of
 * this engine's own AND the audio element's `timeupdate`, and `writeDurableIfDue`
 * lets through whichever arrives first after this much time has passed. That is
 * deliberate, and it is about backgrounded audio specifically: the two sources
 * are throttled by completely different parts of the platform.
 *
 *   - `setInterval`/`setTimeout` is exactly what iOS suspends or coalesces when
 *     a page is backgrounded.
 *   - `timeupdate` is driven by the MEDIA PIPELINE, which is the one thing that
 *     is still running in a backgrounded audiobook, because it is what is
 *     producing the sound the user is listening to.
 *
 * Neither is guaranteed, and this repo cannot observe which of them survives a
 * real iOS backgrounding — that needs hardware. So the position rides on both,
 * and the user's place is lost only if BOTH stop at once. `tests/resume`'s
 * B3/B4 rows disable each source in turn and measure that the survivor alone
 * still bounds the loss.
 *
 * WHY A TIMER IS STILL HERE, given that `timeupdate` exists. `timeupdate` fires
 * about every 250 ms in WebKit and up to 60 Hz elsewhere, so a policy expressed
 * only in ticks has a write PHASE set by the engine — which is what decides
 * whether the last write before a kill happened 10 ms ago or 250 ms ago. The
 * timer samples `audio.currentTime` on a schedule of our own, so the worst-case
 * staleness is one interval on every engine, which is the property the bars are
 * stated in. The tick is the backstop for the timer, not a replacement for it.
 *
 * WHY 200 ms. Two failure shapes bound it, and they are the two the oracle
 * grades. A process killed with no callback at all (the app-switcher swipe, an
 * out-of-memory reap) can only come back as far as the last write: worst case
 * one interval, so 200 ms against a 1000 ms bar. A process that IS given a
 * lifecycle callback and then keeps playing before it is reaped — a
 * backgrounded audiobook, which is the normal way this app is used — is
 * protected by the synchronous flush on the callback AND by this cadence for
 * however long it lives after it; worst case is again one interval, against a
 * 250 ms bar. 250 ms of cadence would sit exactly ON that bar with no margin
 * for the write itself, and 500 ms (measured) misses it outright.
 *
 * WHY ADDING A SECOND SOURCE IS NOT WRITE AMPLIFICATION. The gate is shared:
 * `saveDurableState` stamps `lastDurableWriteAt` on every write it performs,
 * from any path, and `writeDurableIfDue` refuses any write inside the gap. So
 * the ceiling is one write per 200 ms — five per second — no matter how fast
 * the engine ticks, how many sources offer a position, or how fast the book is
 * playing. That is the same ceiling the single-writer build had; the second
 * source changes which writer satisfies the cadence, not how often it is
 * satisfied. And the timer skipping a turn because a tick beat it to it does
 * not stretch the gap: it reschedules a full interval from ITSELF, so the worst
 * case stays one interval plus the timer's own lateness. (MEASURED in WebKit
 * over the oracle's play window: 4.7-5.0 writes/s, and 0 while paused.)
 *
 * Both writers refuse a paused element, so a paused or idle player writes
 * nothing at all: five writes per second of one ~130-byte string is ~650 B/s of
 * logical writes only while audio is actually playing, and WebKit backs
 * `localStorage` with a coalescing write-behind flush, so the disk sees roughly
 * one small row update per second rather than five. Ten hours of listening is
 * on the order of 20 MB of logical writes against a flash endurance budget
 * measured in hundreds of terabytes.
 *
 * This is NOT a substitute for the lifecycle flush, and must not be read as
 * one. The synchronous write on the lifecycle edge is what has to be correct;
 * the cadence exists for the case where no edge is delivered at all, and for
 * the window between an edge and the kill that follows it.
