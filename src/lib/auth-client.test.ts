/**
 * The sign-out hook's ORDERING — `docs/local-first.md` section 11.
 *
 * The purge itself is proved in `offline/account-purge.test.ts` against real
 * IndexedDB. What is proved here is the thing that test could never see: that
 * the auth client does not hand control back to its caller until the sweep has
 * run, and that the outbox is drained on the way OUT rather than on the way
 * back, while the session cookie the replay needs is still valid.
 *
 * The purge module is replaced so the sequence is observable. Fire-and-forget
 * looks identical to awaited when every step is a resolved promise; each step
 * here takes a real macrotask, which is what makes the difference visible.
