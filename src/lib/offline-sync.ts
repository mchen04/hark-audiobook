/**
 * The sync outbox, split by responsibility (`offline-sync/`):
 *
 * - `db.ts` — the IndexedDB schema, versioned migrations and record shapes.
 * - `keys.ts` — the coalesce-key builders that give every intent its identity.
 * - `queue.ts` — journalling and the coalescing policy.
 * - `sequences.ts` — per-book device-sequence counters and their purge.
 * - `replay.ts` — the drain: wire forms, retry classification, delivery.
 * - `reconcile.ts` — what a 409 means, and re-pointing a merged book's rows.
 *
 * This barrel is the module's public surface; nothing outside `offline-sync/`
 * imports the internals directly, and helpers the siblings share stay off it.
