/**
 * Answers one question — can this device play this book right now? — and

 *
 * It used to. A single missed `cache.match` deleted the download record, its
 * journaled cache rows and the book's read-along cues, on a path that runs on
 * every `/library` visit and every player open. WebKit was then measured
 * discarding every Cache Storage *record* for this origin while the cache
 * *names* survived — a heal restored and verified 33 shell and 6 media entries,
 * and seconds later both caches read zero from two pages at once. So
 * `caches.open` resolves, every `match` misses, and the app destroyed the
 * user's downloads and read-along data on the next launch. Putting the bytes
 * back afterwards restores neither.
 *
 * A failed read is not proof of permanent loss, so it is not treated as one:
 *
 * - `undefined` still comes back, which is the ONLY thing the callers ever
 *   needed. `local-media-gate.tsx` turns it into the "this device does not
 *   currently have it — attach the original MP3" screen, and
 *   `listOfflineBooks` drops the book from the playable set. That is already
 *   the correct destination for a book whose bytes are missing.
 * - `offlineMediaUrl` and its `cacheEntries` rows stay, so bytes that come back
 *   are still owned and still reachable rather than swept as orphans.
 * - The transcript stays. It is keyed by book id and was never addressed by the
 *   token that missed; losing read-along data because an audio blob was evicted
 *   is gratuitous.
 * - The record is marked instead, and unmarked as soon as a `match` succeeds.
 *
 * Deletion still happens where it is correct and nowhere else: `removeOfflineBook`
 * (explicit user delete, and the library's remove-download), `clearLocalDataForUser`
 * and `purgeAccount`. None of them route through here.

/**

 * An import queued while the network was down carries an id this device minted,
 * and the bytes, the download record, the cache journal and the read-along cues
 * are all written under it. When that registration finally replays and the
 * server answers 409 — this fingerprint already belongs to book Y — the audio on
 * this device is filed under a name no pull will ever mention: a second copy of
 * the same audiobook, playable here and invisible everywhere else, next to a
 * book Y that asks the user to re-import a file they already imported. Design
 * contract section 10 promises that re-import is lossless and creates no
 * duplicate; this is that promise on the offline path.
 *
 * What moves is the IDENTITY, never the data:
 *
 * - `offlineMediaUrl` is a random token minted at store time and kept on the
 *   record. Nothing derives it from the book id — `media-store.ts` mints it,
 *   `local-media-gate.tsx` and `asOfflinePlayerBook` read it back — so
 *   re-pointing the record leaves every chunk in Cache Storage exactly where it
 *   is. That is the only tolerable shape here: a book can be a 600-hour MP3 and
 *   copying it to rename it would risk `QuotaExceededError` while destroying
 *   the one copy of data that exists nowhere else in the world (section 1).
 * - `cacheEntries.bookId` and the transcript keys travel with it, so the
 *   eviction sweep and the account purge still find the rows they own.
 *
 * Interruption-safe by construction. The move is ONE IndexedDB transaction
 * across the three stores, so it either happened or did not; either way the
 * queued registration is only settled after this returns, and a replay that
 * runs again gets the same deterministic 409 and the same canonical id. Running
 * it twice is a no-op.
