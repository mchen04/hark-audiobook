 * Journal intent, then act.

 * the state the user is shown can never be one the server will not eventually
 * be told about. A crash between the two leaves an unapplied outbox row, which
 * replay delivers and the next pull mirrors — recoverable. The reverse order
 * would leave a mirrored change with no queued write, which is a lost write and
 * is not recoverable from anything.
 *
 * KNOWN DEVIATION from `docs/local-first.md` section 5 rule 1: the outbox lives
 * in `chapterline-sync-v1` and the mirror in `chapterline-offline-v1`, and
 * IndexedDB transactions cannot span two databases — `IDBDatabase.transaction`
 * takes store names within one connection and there is no cross-database
 * primitive in the specification. Section 4 keeps the two databases separate on
 * purpose, so "one transaction" for both is unimplementable as written. What is
 * implemented instead is the ordering that carries the same guarantee, and it
 * is the same shape `deletion-journal.ts` already uses (journal row committed,
 * then bytes removed). Within each database the write is a single transaction:
 * the outbox row lands atomically, and the whole mirror patch lands atomically
