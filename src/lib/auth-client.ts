/**
 * Account lifecycle purge is wired here rather than in the sign-in and
 * sign-out components so that no future call site can forget it: every
 * successful auth request passes through this one hook.
 *
 * Both directions run (`docs/local-first.md` section 11) — purging on sign-in
 * as well as sign-out is what covers a crash between the two.
 *
 * SIGN-OUT IS THREE PHASES, and the order of them is the whole design:
 *
 *  1. `onRequest` — the outbox is drained BEFORE the sign-out request is sent,
 *     because that is the last instant the session cookie the replay needs is
 *     still valid. Drain it in `onSuccess` and every write gets a 401.
 *  2. the request itself.
 *  3. `onSuccess` — the departing account's identity is read SYNCHRONOUSLY,
 *     before any `await`, and the sweep is AWAITED. Both halves are load-bearing.
 *     `@/lib/offline/account-purge` has no static importer, so in a production
 *     build it is a separate chunk and `await import(...)` is a real network
 *     fetch; reading `ACTIVE_USER_KEY` after it let the caller's own
 *     `removeItem` win the race, at which point the purge saw `null`, swept
 *     only the page cache, and left the mirror, the downloaded MP3s, the
 *     outbox, the history and the deletion journal on the device. And firing it
 *     unawaited let the caller navigate away mid-sweep.
 *
 * SIGN-IN IS ALSO AWAITED, with a bound. It is the crash-recovery path — the
 * thing that finishes a purge an earlier sign-out never completed — so running
 * it unawaited meant the incoming account's library painted over a sweep still
 * in progress, and a closed tab abandoned it entirely. See
 * `SIGN_IN_PURGE_TIMEOUT_MS` for why the wait is bounded rather than absolute.
