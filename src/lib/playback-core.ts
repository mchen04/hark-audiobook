 * WHICH MECHANISM performed a durable write — not which function called it.

 * backgrounded with the screen off and audio playing, does iOS suspend BOTH the
 * 200 ms rescheduling timer AND the media element's `timeupdate`? Each writer
 * alone is measured to bound the loss; only their simultaneous suspension loses
 * ground, and the automated suite cannot observe it because Playwright's WebKit
 * never reports a page as genuinely hidden.
 *
 * The answer is legible from the record itself once the record says who wrote
 * it. After a backgrounded listen, `"visibility-flush"` with a stale `writtenAt`
 * means both writers were frozen for the whole session; `"media-tick"` or
 * `"cadence-timer"` with a recent one means that writer survived.
 *
 * So these are named for the PLATFORM MECHANISM that produced the write —
 * `"media-tick"` is the media pipeline, `"cadence-timer"` is `setTimeout` — and
 * not for the hook or handler the call sits in, because it is the mechanism's
 * survival that is in question.

 *
 * The path that proved it (`tests/resume/uncovered-axes.spec.ts` X3, measured in
 * WebKit): device A is paused at 6793 ms and its tab is left open; device B
 * takes the book to 15666 ms; A's tab is then navigated away from. `pagehide` is
 * terminal at any visibility so it flushes unconditionally — correctly, it is
 * the last task a killed iOS page gets — and the flush rewrote A's own record as
 * the SAME 6793 ms with an `occurredAt` 15.4 s newer. Nothing about the user's
 * position changed; only the clock did. `localWinsOver` then read that fresher
 * stamp, preferred it over the server's newer cross-device value, and A came
 * back 8873 ms behind, throwing away listening the user had really done, with no
 * user input anywhere in the sequence.
 *

 * which matters: the same unconditional flush is what saves the position in the
 * single-device crash cases, and removing it to fix this would trade one lost
 * position for another. A write that moves the position by even a millisecond
 * still stamps `Date.now()`, because then there IS new listening to claim.
 *

 * backgrounded with the book playing, iOS suspended both the 200 ms timer and

 * on a development machine, see `docs/resume-durability-device-check.md` — and
 * the process was then reaped with no further callback. The measured cost of
 * that case is the entire session: `tests/resume`'s both-writers-dead row loses
 * 9644 ms out of 9500 ms of listening, scaling linearly.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a claim that iOS does suspend both writers, and
 * it does not need one. If either writer survives a real backgrounding the last
 * record names that writer, the predicate returns null, and the user never sees
 * anything. The cost in the good case is one `localStorage` read at launch.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO is move anybody. The returned position is a PROPOSAL
 * for a control the user has to press. Resuming forward on the strength of an
 * extrapolation would skip content the user never heard — the worst failure
 * this player has, and a blocker here at any magnitude — and it would be
 * straightforwardly wrong in the case where iOS stopped the audio too.
 *

 *
 *   - a record that names any other writer is a record something wrote after
 *     the hide edge, so there is no unrecorded stretch;
 *   - a hide edge taken while PAUSED has nothing behind it to recover;
 *   - a finished book has no unheard stretch behind it;
 *   - a missing or nonsensical rate falls back to 1x rather than scaling the
 *     estimate by a number nobody wrote;
 *   - the projection is clamped to the book, and the offer is withdrawn when
 *     what survives the clamp is under the floor.
