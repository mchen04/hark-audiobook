 * A delete supersedes an UNSENT import of the same file.

 * the outbox replays rows in key order with four in flight — not in the order
 * the user expressed them. So a registration queued before the delete lands
 * after it, finds the fingerprint free because the delete just released it, and
 * creates the book again. The user's delete is not lost in transit; it is
 * undone by an intent they had already superseded, and the book comes back.
 *
 * Resolving it here rather than at replay is what makes it deterministic: this
 * runs inside the SAME transaction that journals the delete, so there is no
 * window in which both rows exist and no ordering to get right afterwards.
 *
 * Two ways a queued registration is recognised as being about the deleted book,
 * because there are two ways the user can be looking at one. `payload.bookId`
 * matches the row the import itself created on this device — the "device-only"
 * book the library projects from a download record before any pull mentions it.
 * The fingerprint matches the other case: a re-import of a book this device
 * already knows, where the registration carries an id the server will discard.
