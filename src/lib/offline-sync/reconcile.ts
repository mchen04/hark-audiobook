 * read-along cues — and it imports this module for the account purge, so a
 * static edge back up to it would close a cycle. Instead the two moments where
 * reconciliation must touch that layer — a 409 that merges an offline import
 * into a canonical book, and a 409 that hands back the server's progress state
 * — are published through these handlers, which `offline/library.ts` registers
 * at its own module init. That init is not guaranteed to have run: a page can
 * mount the player without ever loading the library layer, and a replay from
 * there drains the queue with no handler in place. The contract is therefore
 * retain-and-defer — a 409 that cannot be reconciled yet keeps its row and is
 * retried on a later drain, exactly as a network failure would be. A visit to
 * any page that loads the library layer completes the reconciliation.

/**
 * Re-addresses every queued row that still names the id a merge just abandoned.

 * long before the server has heard of it, and every one of those writes is
 * queued against that id. When the registration finally replays and the server
 * answers "those bytes are already book Y", the id they all name stops existing:
 * each row would replay into a 404, which is terminal, and be dropped as
 * settled. The user's rename is gone, their tag is gone, and their DELETE is
 * gone while the book quietly survives as Y.
 *
 * Two rows can become one intent here — a queued rename for the phantom and a
 * queued rename for Y are now the same edit. The later one wins, decided by
 * `queuedAt` and then handed to the shipping `resolveCoalescing`, rather than
 * one silently overwriting the other. `queuedAt` is the only ordering the pair
 * share: their device sequences were minted from two different books' counters.
 *
 * Progress is re-stamped with a sequence minted from the TARGET book's counter.
 * The server discards a progress write whose `deviceSequence` is not above what
 * it holds for (user, book, device) — and answers 200 while doing it — so a
 * sequence carried over from the phantom's counter is a write that reports
 * success and vanishes.
 *
 * Idempotent: a second run finds nothing naming the old id. That is what makes
 * it safe to do in a different database from the identity move it accompanies —
 * an interruption between the two halves leaves the registration queued, and
 * the next drain gets the same deterministic 409 and finishes the other half.
