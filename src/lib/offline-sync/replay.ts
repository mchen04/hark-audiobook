/**
 * A queued progress row must not be the last word when this device already
 * knows a newer position for the same book.
 *
 * MEASURED, WebKit, hard kill: Postgres left holding 15245 ms against a true
 * position of 3231 ms. The 15 s server heartbeat queued the pre-rewind
 * position, the SIGKILL killed the write that would have followed the rewind,
 * and replay then delivered the queued value verbatim — carrying its ORIGINAL
 * `eventOccurredAt`, which the server's staleness policy compares against what
 * it holds rather than against what the device knows. The user was protected
 * only by `localWinsOver` on a ~1 s timestamp margin; a fresh install, a second
 * device or cleared storage makes the server authoritative and the user skips
 * ~12 seconds of a book they paid for.
 *
 * The outbox's own coalescing would have collapsed the two events into one had
 * the newer position ever been journalled. It was not — it only ever reached
 * the synchronous local write, which is the ONLY write a terminating iOS page
 * is guaranteed to complete, and is therefore the freshest thing this device
 * has. So the collapse is applied here instead, from that record, and the row
 * is rewritten in place: same intent ("where this user is in this book"), same
 * device, later moment. Nothing is invented — every field comes from a write
 * the app already made durable.
 *
 * A fresh `deviceSequence` is minted for the same reason `repointQueuedMutations`
 * mints one: the server discards a progress write whose sequence is not above
 * the last it recorded for (user, book, device), and answers 200 while doing
 * it, so re-using the stale row's number risks reporting success and vanishing.
 * It is minted at most once per row — the rewritten row's `eventOccurredAt` is
 * the local record's own, so the next pass finds nothing newer to fold in.
