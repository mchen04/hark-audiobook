 *   counters, and a counter that restarts below the server's high-water mark
 *   loses every write until it catches up.
 * - **A value can only rise.** The scoped row takes the maximum of whatever is
 *   already there and the value being carried across, so re-running this step
 *   over a partially attributed store cannot lower a counter.
 *
 * The store is snapshotted with `getAll` rather than walked with a cursor,
