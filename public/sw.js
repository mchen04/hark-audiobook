 * ask, and Chromium hedges that wait by speculatively fetching the same
 * document from the network (`ServiceWorkerAutoPreload`). The paint never waits
 * for that request and the page still comes from the cache, so it costs the

 * queries on every cold launch, and the response is thrown away. Measured: six
 * discarded renders and 24 queries per benchmark run.
 *
 * A static route states the answer declaratively, so the browser satisfies the
 * navigation from the cache without starting the worker and has nothing left to
 * hedge against.
 *
 * TWO THINGS HERE ARE LOAD-BEARING, and getting either wrong is worse than not
 * doing this at all — a routing MISS goes straight to the network rather than
 * falling back to the `fetch` handler below, which would put the entire launch
 * document back on the wire:
 *
 *  - the condition matches the start_url EXACTLY, pathname and search. Every
 *    other navigation (`/library`, `/library?device=1`, `/books/:id`) is
 *    deliberately left to `serveNavigation`, which handles them correctly and
 *    is not query-sensitive. A rule written as a bare pathname would claim
 *    those too and miss on all of them.
 *  - `precacheShell` stores the shell under this exact key, so the lookup this
 *    rule performs is guaranteed to hit.
 *
 * `addRoutes` is Chromium-only and rejects a malformed rule, so it is guarded:
 * where it is unsupported nothing changes and the `fetch` handler stays
 * authoritative. This only ever changes WHO answers, never WHAT is answered.
