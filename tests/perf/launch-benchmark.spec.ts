/**
 * The launch benchmark.
 *
 * It answers one question: how long after the icon tap is the user's REAL
 * library on screen, on every network the user can be on — and it is built so
 * that it cannot answer that question dishonestly.
 *
 * Seven things guard the number:
 *   1. The library is seeded to a realistic size and the size is asserted, so a
 *      two-book library can never make the bar trivial.
 *   2. Every measured launch closes the browser process and relaunches
 *      `launchPersistentContext` against the SAME user data dir, and the
 *      service worker's survival is re-proved (in a freshly relaunched process)
 *      before each profile. The profile stays warm; the process does not. That
 *      is what an iOS Home-Screen tap actually is: iOS kills backgrounded PWAs,
 *      so nearly every real launch pays a browser start and a service-worker
 *      cold start. A single long-lived context excludes both.
 *   3. Server hit counts, not timings, decide whether the document came from
 *      cache. A fast server and a cached document look identical on a clock.
 *   4. Each delayed profile proves its delay actually bit, and the offline
 *      profile proves the network really is gone, before its launches count.
 *   5. The CPU budget is normalized before measurement by timing a fixed
 *      CPU-bound loop and choosing the throttle that makes that work cost the
 *      same on every capable host. `devices["iPhone 15"]` sets viewport, user
 *      agent, device pixel ratio and touch — it does not touch CPU, and almost
 *      every millisecond of a warm launch is device-local CPU work.
 *   6. What was PAINTED is asserted, not just that some marker appeared. The
 *      app sets `data-launch-ready="empty"` on the "Bring your first audiobook"
 *      screen, so a mirror that was never synced, or was evicted or purged,
 *      paints an empty box in ~0ms and would otherwise report a superb number
 *      with zero queries. Every launch on this 1000-book account must report
 *      the "books" marker AND a counted, non-zero number of rendered book
 *      cards, captured inside the page in the same tick the marker lands.
 *   7. The reported number is wall clock measured in Node, which over-reports.
 *      The in-page figure is printed beside every launch.
 *
 * The 500ms and 150ms bars are frozen. Nothing in this file may relax them.
