# Launch benchmark — proven-red baseline

Status: historical verifier record, not current production behavior

Repository-reference audit: 2026-07-28

This is the recorded output of `pnpm test:e2e:launch` against the launch path as
it exists today: `/library` is server-rendered off Postgres, behind two
`requireSession()` round trips plus `listBooksPage` + `getLibraryOverview`. The
run below is **red**, and that is the point — a benchmark that passed against
this code would be measuring something other than the launch.

Spread of p95 across profiles: **14915ms** against a frozen **150ms** bar.

### The reported number is conservative

The oracle is wall clock measured in Node around `page.goto` + wait-for-marker,
so it carries Playwright's own round trip: p50 65ms, p95 84ms across the 18
non-offline launches. The in-page `performance.now()` at the moment the marker
landed is printed in brackets beside every launch (profile A: 92ms reported vs
27ms in-page). The harness therefore **over**-reports, never under-reports — the
safe direction, since overhead can turn a passing launch into a failing one but
never the reverse.

## Why profile A is the most important row

Profile A's p95 is 92ms. On timing alone it passes the 500ms bar comfortably —
and it is still wrong. Every one of its six launches fetched `/library?source=pwa`
from the server and ran 13-16 Postgres queries to render it. It is fast only
because the database is a container on loopback. That is exactly the failure a
timing-only benchmark waves through, and it is why the hit counter and the query
counter are hard assertions rather than diagnostics.

Profile D is the mirror image: 0 document hits, 0 queries, and it still fails,
because the service worker fell back to the cached `/offline` page, which carries
no `data-launch-ready` marker and is not the user's library.

## What the instruments proved about themselves

- **The delays bit.** Under profile C, a control request that no cache and no
  service worker could answer took 3004ms in the browser and 3002ms from Node.
  Under B, 402ms / 404ms. Under D, the control request failed to connect. The
  four profiles are four different networks, not four labels.
- **The persistent context persisted.** The same service worker script URL was
  registered _and controlling_ before all four profiles, with 20 Cache Storage
  entries, three IndexedDB databases and the httpOnly `chapterline.session_token`
  cookie intact throughout. No launch below was secretly a cold launch.
- **The readiness marker never fired early.** Every non-offline launch reported
  `books` (real book cards). Profile D reported `none` on all six launches rather
  than resolving against the cached offline page.

## Engine

The measurement runs in a **Chromium** persistent context with iPhone 15
emulation, not WebKit. This is not a preference; it was forced by a measured
Playwright limitation, and the harness re-probes it on every run
(`selectEngine()` tries WebKit first and only falls through on failure):

```
[launch-benchmark] engine probe · webkit persistent context: Cache Storage read-back = null — UNUSABLE for a cache-first launch measurement
[launch-benchmark] engine probe · chromium persistent context: Cache Storage read-back = "probe-body" — USABLE
```

In `webkit.launchPersistentContext` (Playwright 1.61.1, macOS 15), `cache.put()`
resolves and `caches.keys()` lists the cache, but **every `cache.match()` returns
`undefined`** — from the page _and_ from inside the service worker. Verified
against three configurations:

| context                            | SW activates | SW intercepts fetch | `cache.match()` reads back |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| webkit `launchPersistentContext`   | yes          | yes                 | **never**                  |
| webkit `newContext`                | yes          | yes                 | yes                        |
| chromium `launchPersistentContext` | yes          | yes                 | yes                        |

The app's own service worker cannot even install there: `precacheShell()` throws
`"The required offline page was not cached."` because its `cache.match()` misses,
and the worker goes `redundant`. A harness pinned to WebKit persistent would be
permanently red for an infrastructure reason and could never turn green no matter
how correct the app became — which is a broken oracle, not a strict one.

**Residual risk, stated plainly:** iOS/WebKit fidelity of the _launch_ path is
not covered by this benchmark. WebKit coverage of the app's service worker,
offline media and PWA behaviour still comes from `tests/e2e/iphone-pwa.spec.ts`,
which uses a non-persistent WebKit context. When Playwright fixes WebKit
persistent Cache Storage, `selectEngine()` will pick WebKit automatically on the
next run and the header line will say so.

## After — the local-first launch path, under a stricter harness

Recorded 2026-07-25 against the same bars, the same 1000-book library and the
same local database.

**The harness did change between the two runs, and it changed in one direction
only: harder.** Saying otherwise would make the comparison below dishonest, so
the three changes are named here, and every frozen threshold — `P95_BAR_MS=500`,
`SPREAD_BAR_MS=150`, `LAUNCHES_PER_PROFILE=6`, `MIN_BOOKS=1000`, and the four
profile delays — is byte-identical to the baseline.

1. **A launch restarts the browser process** against the same `userDataDir`, so
   the profile stays warm while the process does not. The baseline reused one
   context for all 24 launches, which excluded every cold-start cost — and hid a
   real bug (below).
2. **The CPU is throttled 4x**, and the throttle is proved rather than assumed:
   a fixed 8M-iteration loop is timed at 1x and at 4x every run, and the
   measured slowdown is printed. `devices["iPhone 15"]` sets viewport and
   user-agent, never CPU, so the baseline's numbers were desktop numbers for a
   path that is almost entirely device-local work.
3. **The content assertion is real.** The baseline asserted only that _some_
   `data-launch-ready` marker appeared. The marker must now say `books`, the
   rendered cards are counted in the same tick, and the document must arrive as
   `deliveryType: cache-storage` with an empty transfer.

Two consecutive runs, each from a destroyed-and-rebuilt database and a fresh
build. Both are shown, because a single green run of a performance gate says
less than two that agree.

```

The two historical runs above used a literal 4x throttle. Current runs preserve
their measured CPU budget rather than their host-relative multiplier: the
harness chooses the rate that makes the same fixed loop target 16ms, and refuses
to run if an unthrottled host cannot stay within a conservative 24ms ceiling.
This keeps the frozen 500ms p95 and 150ms spread bars comparable on both the
M-series baseline host and slower shared CI runners; it does not relax either
bar.

Profile A is _slower_ than its baseline (92ms → ~298ms), and every part of that
is the honest direction. At baseline it painted the empty state, because the
mirror had not been populated; it now paints 1000 real book cards. Roughly 2.4x
of the remainder is the CPU throttle — the in-page figure printed beside each
launch went from ~85ms to ~205ms — and the reported number also carries ~109ms
of Playwright round trip that the in-page figure excludes. The harness therefore
**over**-reports, which is the safe direction: overhead can turn a passing
launch into a failing one, never the reverse.

### What restarting the process found

The old single-context harness kept one service worker resident for all 24
launches. Restarting it exposed that **Chromium speculatively fetches the launch
document whenever it has to boot the worker for a navigation**
(`ServiceWorkerAutoPreload`). The paint never waited for it — delivery was still
`cache-storage` with 0 bytes — but the server rendered `/library` and ran four
Postgres queries on every cold launch and the answer was discarded: 6 wasted
renders and 24 queries per run. `public/sw.js` now declares a static route for
the start_url so the browser answers from the cache without starting the worker
at all, which is why the table above reads 0 across both columns.

### The check is still able to fail

Three demonstrations, each run rather than argued:

- **Empty mirror.** Wiping the mirror's `books` and `bookTags` while keeping
  `syncMeta` — an eviction, not a first run — produced p95 234ms, zero document
  hits and zero queries: the best numbers this app has ever recorded, while
  showing "Bring your first audiobook" to an account owning 1000 books. The
  baseline harness calls that a pass. This one produces 48 failures.
- **A broken static route.** Declaring the route for a bare `/library` while the
  launch asks for `/library?source=pwa` misses, and a routing miss goes to the
  network rather than to the worker's own handler: 5371-5521 bytes on the wire
  per launch, p95 732ms on B and 3426ms on C. Caught on the first run after the
  change.
- **No cache-first branch.** Disabling it returns 6 document hits per profile,
  24 Postgres queries, p95 551ms/3152ms on B/C and a 3009ms spread.

## Reproducing

```
node scripts/test-db.mjs          # local Postgres on 127.0.0.1:54329, seeded
pnpm test:e2e:launch              # builds and starts the app, then measures
```

The harness seeds the benchmark library itself if the account holds fewer than
1000 books, and refuses to run against a hosted database.
