 * The four axes `position-drift.spec.ts` is structurally unable to see.
 *
 * That matrix measures ONE book, on ONE device, with the app's lifecycle
 * handlers intact, and grades the position the PLAYER comes back at. Four real
 * failures live outside that shape, and each one was found by something other
 * than this suite:
 *
 *   S1  The server left holding a position the user rewound away from. The
 *       player is protected by its own local record, so a client-only oracle
 *       reports a clean pass while Postgres — the only witness a second device
 *       or a fresh install has — serves twelve seconds of skipped content.
 *   B1/B2
 *       What the 200 ms cadence preserves ON ITS OWN, with every lifecycle
 *       handler deleted. T1 cannot be covered here (see `assertHiddenIsReal`),
 *       and stays an engine GAP; this bounds the damage of the case T1 is
 *       worried about instead of leaving its size unknown.
 *   B3/B4
 *       The cell B1/B2's own comment names as UNCOVERED: no callback AND one of
 *       the two position writers gone. Each row deletes a different writer and
 *       measures what the survivor holds alone.
 *   W1  What the second writer COSTS: the durable write rate, playing and at
 *       rest. Two writers is the shape that silently doubles somebody's write
 *       amplification, and none of the drift rows can see it.
 *   X2  One device republishing over another device's newer position. A
 *       single-device oracle has no other device.
 *   F2  Opening the next book un-finishing the previous one. A single-book
 *       oracle has no next book.
 *
 * Ordering is deliberate. B1/B2 run first, while the fixture books still have
 * their full length available; the rows after them reset the book they use, on
 * every witness, because they need a known amount of headroom.
 */

/**
 * One book per scenario, and F2 needs two.

/**
 * T1's residual, converted from unprovable into BOUNDED BY COMPOSITION.
 *
 * T1 asks whether the app survives a real iOS backgrounding. This instrument
 * cannot make WebKit report a page hidden for real — there is no
 * `Page.setActivityState` anywhere in `playwright-core`, and a second page plus
 * `bringToFront()` leaves the measured page at `"visible"` and fires no
 * `visibilitychange` at all — so T1 stays a GAP, is graded green nowhere, and
 * `assertHiddenIsReal` keeps saying so. These rows do not cover it. What they do
 * is make the size of what is uncovered a measured quantity instead of an
 * unknown, and the argument is worth stating exactly, because "unknown"
 * understates it and "covered" would be a lie.
 *
 * THREE INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS STAND BETWEEN A BACKGROUNDED LISTENER AND A LOST
 * POSITION: the synchronous flush on the lifecycle edge, a 200 ms self-
 * rescheduling timer that samples the element directly, and the media element's
 * own `timeupdate` (all in `use-progress-persistence.ts`). Each has been
 * measured working ALONE.
 *
 *   (a) THE FLUSH, GIVEN THE STATE. The harness overrides
 *       `document.visibilityState` before dispatching, so the app's handler
 *       reads `"hidden"` — the row carries `visibilityAtCallback` as an
 *       observation rather than an assumption, and the app gates its flush on
 *       exactly that value. MEASURED, WebKit, build A7stcwm1IFdVIdgFWr4h9: T1
 *       online drift 39 ms / shelf 39 ms, T1 offline 26 ms / 26 ms.
 *
 *   (b) THE CADENCE, WITH THE FLUSH DELETED. B1/B2 remove every lifecycle
 *       registration the app makes before it can make it, prove the poison bit
 *       (`lifecycleBlocked`), and prove the platform still delivered the
 *       callback (`lifecycle`), so "the app could not use it" is distinguishable
 *       from "it never happened". MEASURED, same build: B1 152 ms, B2 69 ms
 *       against the 600 ms bar below. That bar is proven able to fail — at the
 *       old 5 s cadence the same rows measured 4708 ms and 2867 ms.
 *
 * WHAT THE UNION ESTABLISHES. The two legs do not depend on each other, so a
 * real backgrounding loses the user's place only if BOTH fail at once: the
 * platform never delivers a usable `visibilitychange` AND the timer stops before
 * its next tick. Either one surviving is enough, and each was measured surviving
 * with the other removed. The cost of a SINGLE failure is bounded and known: one
 * cadence interval with no callback, the flush's own latency with one.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT ESTABLISH, and must never be read as:
 *
 *   1. That iOS delivers the input (a) was handed. The state was SYNTHESISED.
 *      (a) says the handler is correct when given a hidden `visibilitychange`;
 *      it says nothing about whether the platform gives it one. If real iOS
 *      fires the event with the state still `"visible"`, or does not fire it
 *      before freezing, leg (a) contributes nothing and only (b) is left.
 *   2. That the timer keeps running once iOS has frozen the page. B1/B2 bound
 *      "no callback". They do not bound "no callback AND no timer" — B3/B4 do,
 *      and the size of the hole they close is measured: with the callback gone
 *      and BOTH writers deleted the same row loses 9644 ms and writes nothing
 *      at all, because a backgrounded audiobook keeps PLAYING while a frozen
 *      page records nothing, so the loss is the length of the background
 *      session and not one interval. T3 does not cover that: T3's page was
 *      foregrounded and ticking right up to the SIGKILL, so its timer had never
 *      stopped.
 *   3. The three-way joint failure that is left: no callback, no timer, and no
 *      tick. It is smaller than the two-way one it replaces, because the tick
 *      is emitted by the media pipeline — if that has stopped, the audio has
 *      stopped, and there is no new position to lose. It is not nothing: this
 *      instrument cannot see whether iOS coalesces `timeupdate` on a
 *      backgrounded page, only that it fires while the page is foreground.
 *
 * So: the real-world risk is bounded by composition, the single cell is not
 * proven, and covering it needs an engine that can genuinely report a hidden
 * page, or real hardware.
 *
 * THE BAR. These rows get the no-callback bar's CASE but a stricter number:
 * 600 ms, three times the cadence, instead of the 1000 ms `HARD_KILL_BAR_MS`
 * the repo gives a SIGKILL. The cadence's own worst case is one interval, so
 * anything near 1000 ms would mean the cadence is not doing the job this row
 * exists to test.

 * largest remaining real-world risk, because the way this app is used is audio
 * playing with the screen off — the one state in which iOS suspends timers.
 *
 * The app now writes the durable position from TWO sources, and the point of
 * two is that the platform throttles them through different machinery:
 *
 *   - the 200 ms timer is what iOS suspends or coalesces on a backgrounded page;
 *   - `timeupdate` is emitted by the MEDIA PIPELINE, which is by definition
 *     still running in a backgrounded audiobook, because it is producing the
 *     sound.
 *
 * Neither is guaranteed. So the requirement is not "one of them works" — it is
 * that EITHER ONE ALONE bounds the loss, because then the position is lost only
 * if both stop at once. That is a composition argument, and it is only worth
 * anything if each leg is measured with the other leg REMOVED. These two rows
 * are those measurements: same no-callback world as B1/B2, with one writer
 * deleted before the app can install it.
 *
 * WHAT THEY STILL DO NOT COVER, and must never be read as covering: a real iOS
 * backgrounding. The state is synthesised here exactly as it is in T1, and
 * `assertHiddenIsReal` keeps saying so. What changes is the size of the
 * residual: the joint failure now needs the platform to deliver no callback AND
 * suspend the timer AND stop the media pipeline's tick — and if it stops the
 * tick, it has stopped decoding, which means the audiobook is not playing and
 * there is no new position to lose.
 *
 * THE BAR is `CADENCE_ONLY_BAR_MS`, the same 600 ms B1/B2 are held to and
 * stricter than the 1000 ms this repo gives a no-callback case. It is the right
 * number for both writers: the timer's worst case is one 200 ms interval, and
 * WebKit's `timeupdate` arrives about every 250 ms, so either survivor should
 * land far inside it. A row near the bar would mean the survivor is not doing
 * the job, which is the finding, not an excuse to widen it.

   * The obvious gate — "the book was marked finished before the next one
   * opened" — is unusable, and measuring it is what showed why. On the build
   * with the defect, `markEnded` and the autoplay `router.push` fire off the
   * same `ended` event, so the un-finishing write lands in the same tick: the
   * pre-fix run recorded `finishedLocalBefore: false`, `finishedMirrorBefore:
   * false`, `finishedServerBefore: false`. There is no instant at which the
   * flag can be caught. A gate on it would report the exact failure this row
   * exists to name as "the precondition was not met" — the failure hiding
   * behind its own detector.
   *
   * So the precondition is what the USER did: the book reached its end
   * (the harness fails hard if it did not), the app navigated itself to the
   * next book, and the document was never replaced on the way. Whether the
   * completion flag was briefly true in between is not a requirement; that it
   * is true AFTERWARDS is, and that is what is graded below. The `...Before`
   * columns stay in the row because WHEN the flag was lost is evidence.
