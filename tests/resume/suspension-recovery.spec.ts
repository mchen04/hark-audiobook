/**
 * The one durability question this machine cannot answer, and the safety net
 * that makes it not matter.
 *
 * THE QUESTION (`docs/resume-durability-device-check.md`): while the PWA is
 * backgrounded with the screen off and
 * audio playing, does iOS suspend BOTH the 200 ms cadence timer AND the media
 * element's `timeupdate`? Playwright's WebKit never reports a page as genuinely
 * hidden, `setActivityState` does not exist in `playwright-core`, macOS Safari
 * does not reproduce iOS's background suspension, and the Simulator needs Xcode.
 * So the question stays open on this machine and `assertHiddenIsReal` keeps
 * saying so.
 *
 * THE CONSEQUENCE IF THE ANSWER IS YES is already measured: with both writers
 * dead, `uncovered-axes`' control row loses 9644 ms across a 9500 ms session —
 * 100% of it, scaling linearly. A long screen-off listen would lose the whole
 * thing.
 *
 * WHAT THESE ROWS ARE. Not an attempt to answer the question. They measure the
 * SAFETY NET, which is entirely measurable here: given the exact signature a
 * suspended session leaves behind, does the app (a) come back at the recorded
 * position and NEVER ahead of it, (b) offer the user a labelled estimate of
 * where the audio would have got to, and (c) shut up about it once told to?
 * And, the row that stops this from being an everyday annoyance: (d) does it
 * stay silent after an ORDINARY backgrounding, where the writers did their job?
 *
 * If iOS never suspends anything, none of this ever fires — the detection
 * requires that no later write exist, and a surviving writer makes one. R2 is
 * the row that proves that half.
 *
 * ADDITIVE. Nothing here modifies, relaxes or shares a book with
 * `position-drift.spec.ts` or `uncovered-axes.spec.ts`.
 */

const BOOK_COUNT = 3;

/**
 * The size of the unrecorded stretch these rows grade.
 *
 * Two minutes: twice the app's own 60 s floor, so R1 cannot pass by a hair, and
 * far enough above the few seconds a relaunch costs that R2 cannot fail by one
 * either. The gap is SET by the harness, not waited out, so it is exact — see
 * `ageSuspensionWrite` for why moving the clock is the only honest way to reach
 * the size of a real screen-off listen inside a test.
 */

/**
 * R1 and R3 need a book with room to project INTO.
 *
 * The projection is clamped to the duration, and correctly so — but a row whose
 * projection saturates the clamp grades the clamp rather than the extrapolation
 * (the clamp is covered exhaustively in `playback-core.test.ts`). An ordinary
 * fixture book is ~24 s against a 120 s gap, so it would clamp instantly. Each
 * repeat is ~8 s, so 25 of them is ~200 s: about 8 s of playback plus a 120 s
 * projection lands near 129 s, roughly 70 s clear of the end.
 *
 * R2 GETS THE LONG BOOK TOO, and not for symmetry. Its fail-demo
 * (`HARK_RESUME_POISON=recovery-always-offers`) forges a five-minute gap into
 * the record, and on a ~24 s book that projection clamps to the end and leaves
 * an advance under the app's 60 s floor — so the poisoned run would produce no
 * offer and R2 would stay green against the very regression it exists to catch.
 * A row whose fail-demo cannot fire is not graded. MEASURED: the first version
 * of these rows gave R2 a 24137 ms book for exactly that reason.
