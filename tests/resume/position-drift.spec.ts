 * entry took the book away from every later scenario that used it. Measured, on
 * the three-book matrix: C2 and X1 failed at their FIRST `openPlayer` with "this
 * device does not currently have it", for a book damaged four scenarios earlier,
 * while both passed standalone. `preflightDevice` now catches that at the moment
 * it happens rather than where it surfaces, but the coupling itself is worth
 * removing: a shared book also means each row starts wherever the last one left
 * off, which is why several of them had to ask for `resetBookFirst`.
 *
 * The cost is import time and disk, and both are cheap. MEASURED, WebKit
 * ephemeral context, `navigator.storage.estimate()`: quota 1_048_576_000 bytes,
 * and 200 x 98 KB entries written and read back with no error. The "WebKit
 * refuses to hold more than a few hundred kilobytes" note this file used to
