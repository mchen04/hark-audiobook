 * The resume oracle.
 *
 * One question, in the engine of record (WebKit / iPhone 15): when the app goes
 * away at a known instant, does it come back at that instant?
 *
 *   drift = | true position at termination - position after relaunch |
 *
 * The "true position" is never a number the app produced. It is sampled off the
 * `<audio>` element from the driving process microseconds before the
 * termination is issued and carried across the gap by the wall clock.
 *
 * TWO SURFACES ARE GRADED, not one. The user's complaint is "the resume
 * position is behind" — which they can see on the shelf without ever pressing
 * play. A suite that only reads the player's `currentTime` can report a clean
 * pass while the library card shows a stale number on every launch. So every
 * row also carries what the SHELF says, read through a different path (the
 * card's own progressbar and the mirror record it renders from) than the
 * player's `currentTime`, and both are graded against the same bar.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts on `src/`. It measures and records rows with enough
 * evidence to tell a real pass from an instrument that measured nothing; the
 * spec applies the bars.

 *
 * A WebKit persistent context under Playwright 1.61.1 cannot host this app at
 * all. Measured: the page reports `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()`
 * length 0 and `controller === null` for as long as you care to poll, while the
 * worker is demonstrably running (it creates and fills `chapterline-shell-v6`
 * on disk). The page and the worker are in two different storage sessions, so
 * every `cache.put` the page makes is accepted and never readable. Nothing in
 * this repo has ever run Cache Storage in a WebKit persistent context —
 * `tests/perf` uses one but its `selectEngine()` demands CDP CPU throttling,
 * which WebKit refuses, so it always falls through to Chromium.
 *
 * What DOES work in WebKit is what `tests/parity/harness/app.ts` does: an
 * EPHEMERAL `browser.newContext(...)`. That context is treated here as the
 * phone's disk. "The app was killed" is then a SIGKILL of the browser's
 * renderer process (`WebKit.WebContent`), which is precisely what iOS does to a
 * backgrounded PWA — the app's process dies and the device's storage does not.
 *
 * Measured across ordinary kills: cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB and the
 * service-worker registration all survive. Those are every witness the resume
 * position lives in, so the thing under measurement crosses the gap on its own.
 * Under a long run of repeated renderer kills, WebKit has also discarded its
 * entire cookie jar once. The oracle plants an HttpOnly sentinel beside the
 * auth cookie and repairs only when BOTH disappear while the exact snapshotted
 * session is still active in Postgres. A real sign-out removes the auth cookie
 * but leaves that sentinel, and therefore still fails. Cache Storage RECORDS
 * disappear more routinely, which is also a Playwright/WebKit artifact and not
 * something an iPhone does; they hold the audiobook BYTES, which are not under
 * measurement. So the oracle snapshots Cache Storage before the kill and puts
 * it back after the relaunch (`snapshotCaches`/`restoreCaches`), and verifies
 * the restore rather than assuming it.

 * genuinely report `visibilityState === "hidden"` (measured — no
 * `setActivityState` in `playwright-core`, and a second page plus
 * `bringToFront` leaves the first at `"visible"`), so `assertHiddenIsReal`
 * records that cell as an engine GAP and it stays one.
 *
 * But the user-facing question underneath T1 is not "does the handler fire?".
 * It is "if the handler never fires at all, how much do I lose?" — and THAT is
 * answerable here, because the answer does not depend on the platform
 * delivering anything. Deleting every handler and measuring what the cadence
 * alone preserves bounds the residual from above: on a real iPhone the callback
 * either arrives (in which case the drift is the one T1 already measures with
 * the handler alive) or it does not (in which case it is this one). Neither
 * branch is unmeasured.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, and must never be read as covering: iOS may also
 * freeze the timer when it freezes the page. This bounds "no callback"; it does
 * not bound "no callback and no timer". That cell stays UNCOVERED.
 *
 * HOW IT STAYS HONEST. It patches `EventTarget.prototype.addEventListener`, so
 * it drops registrations made AFTER it runs. The oracle's own probe registers
 * in `PROBE_SCRIPT`, which is added to the context first and therefore runs
 * first — so the journal still records that the platform DELIVERED the

 * still not a real backgrounding — no instrument here can produce one — but it
 * removes the same writer iOS would, so what is left is measured rather than
 * assumed.
 *
 * HOW IT IDENTIFIES THE WRITER. By the scheduling delay, which is the only
 * thing distinguishable from outside the page. Nothing else in `src/` schedules
 * anything at 200 ms (checked: the other timers are 0, 500, 800, 2000, 3000,
 * 4000, 30000 and the sleep timer's user-chosen value), and both timer
 * primitives are covered so the poison cannot be defeated by swapping one for
 * the other. A blocked callback is replaced by a real no-op timer, so an id is
 * still returned and `clearTimeout` on it still behaves.
 *
 * THE APP ALSO SCHEDULES SHORTER CATCH-UP DELAYS, and this does not need to
 * match them. Its cadence chain can only be STARTED at exactly this value —
 * from the `play` handler, or from the effect finding an already-playing
 * element — and the shorter delays are only ever scheduled from inside a
 * callback that has already run. Block the start and nothing downstream is ever
 * scheduled, so the writer is dead rather than slowed. The `writersBlocked`
 * assertion in the spec is what keeps that honest if the app ever changes.

/**
 * The first thing every measurement does: make sure the phone still has its

 *
 * WHY THIS REPAIRS RATHER THAN ONLY CHECKING.
 *
 * WebKit's ephemeral Cache Storage does not merely die with a renderer; it is
 * discarded whenever the context stops holding the origin open, and putting the
 * bytes back does not make them stay. MEASURED, in the app's own context, C1 ->
 * C2 with nothing else running:
 *
 *   C1's last cycle ends on a SIGKILL; `healDevice` relaunches, restores both
 *   caches, and READS THEM BACK — 33 shell entries and 6 media entries, every
 *   body the right length. Its page then closes. C2's first look at the same
 *   device, seconds later, finds the cache NAMES still listed and BOTH CACHES
 *   AT ZERO ENTRIES: `{"chapterline-shell-v6":0,"chapterline-media-v2":0}`.
 *
 * That was measured from two different pages at once (a page held open across
 * the whole sequence and a freshly opened one) and both read zero, so it is the
 * origin's records going away, not one page losing sight of them. Holding a
 * page open does NOT prevent it — that was tried, measured, and removed. In a
 * bare context with no app and no service worker the same experiment is stable,
 * so this is specific to the real thing and cannot be worked around by
 * arranging pages.
 *
 * The consequence is not recoverable by waiting, because
 * `reconcileOfflineRecord` deletes a download record whose bytes are missing
 * the moment the app looks — see `readMediaInventory`. So the bytes go back
 * BEFORE the app is allowed to look, from the last snapshot taken, and the
 * result is verified rather than assumed.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. It only fires when EVERY download record
 * on the device has unreadable bytes, which is the signature of the engine
 * throwing the whole origin away. A device that has lost SOME of its media and
 * kept the rest does not match that signature, is not repaired, and fails the
 * assertion below — because that shape could be the product deleting a user's
 * book, and this must never be able to paper over it.

 * second writer is exactly the shape that silently doubles a write rate on
 * somebody's flash, and "we deduplicated it" is a claim, not a measurement. So
 * the number is taken off the page's own `setItem` calls, over a window that
 * begins only once the audio was observed advancing, and it is graded.
 *
 * AND THEN AT REST, which is the half a rate alone cannot show. Five writes per
 * second while a book is playing is nothing next to the audio decode already
 * running; five writes per second for the eight hours a phone sits in a pocket
 * with the app open would be indefensible. Both writers refuse a paused
 * element, so the correct number here is exactly zero, and anything above it is
 * a defect however small the playing rate is.
 *
 * The pause itself performs one legitimate durable write (the `pause` event's
 * `persistProgress`), and the seek debounce is 800 ms, so the at-rest window
 * opens after a settling period and those are attributed to the pause rather
 * than to rest.

 * than against what the device knows. Postgres ends up authoritative for a
 * position the user rewound away from.
 *

 * is invisible: its own local record is newer and `localWinsOver` prefers it, so
 * the player comes back in the right place. The row still records that, because
 * a client that ALSO skipped would be a worse failure. But the user this hurts
 * is the one on a second device, a fresh install, or cleared storage — for whom
 * the server is the only witness, and it is holding twelve seconds of a book

 * Finish a book, open the next one, and ask whether the first is still

 *
 * WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE. Every other row in this oracle measures ONE book, so a
 * write that a second book's arrival makes to the FIRST book is structurally
 * unobservable: there is no second book. `loadBook` persists the previous
 * book's position as it switches, and it used to hand that write a literal
 * `completed: false`.
 *
 * THE NAVIGATION HAS TO BE CLIENT-SIDE, and only one route in this app is.
 * `loadBook` reaches its previous-book branch only when the provider is still
 * holding the first book, and the provider lives in the app shell — so any
 * navigation that reloads the document drops `activeBookRef`, and with no
 * previous book there is no write and the defect cannot fire. MEASURED: going
 * out through the player's Library control and back in through the next book's
 * card lands on a shell whose audio element has no `src` at all
 * (`{"audioCount":1,"currentSrc":"","srcAttribute":null}` — a freshly mounted
 * provider), so that route cannot reach it.
 *
 * So this drives the path the defect was actually reported on: AUTOPLAY-NEXT.
 * Both books go into a collection, the "Play the next book in a collection"
 * preference is switched on through the real settings control, and the first
 * book is played to its end. `FullPlayer` then calls `router.push` itself and
 * the second book arrives without the document ever being replaced — which is
 * exactly why the finished book is ALWAYS the previous one on this path.
 *
 * That the document really did survive is not assumed: a marker is written onto
 * `window` before the first book ends and read back after the second has
 * loaded. A row that lost it is UNCOVERED, never a pass.

 * Two real devices, one account, one book — the axis the oracle could not see.
 *
 * Every other row here runs on ONE device, so a write that one device makes
 * over another device's newer position is structurally invisible: there is no
 * other device. `tests/sync/two-device-convergence.spec.ts` has two, but it
 * drives them through an in-page sync driver and never mounts a player or reads
 * a start position, so the player's own write paths are not on the wire.
 *
 * The journey: A listens and stops. B — a genuinely separate storage session
 * with its own device id — picks the book up, resumes where A left it, and
 * listens further. Then A's tab, still open and still holding its old position,
 * comes back to the foreground.
 *
 * Three questions, all of which need two devices to ask:
 *   1. Did B resume where A left off? (`deviceBStartedAtMs`)
 *   2. Did A's stale tab republish over B's newer write? (`clobberedMs`)
 *   3. Does either device now come back AHEAD of anything the user has heard?
 *
 * Both devices stay alive throughout, so nothing here hard-kills: a SIGKILL is
 * aimed at every renderer this run started, and B's is one of them.
