/**
 * Design contract section 10 — two different losses, two different recoveries.
 *
 * - The MIRROR is metadata that Postgres still holds, so losing it is
 *   recoverable: the app must notice, re-pull, and carry on.
 * - The AUDIO exists on this device and nowhere else in the world. Losing it is
 *   not recoverable from anything. The book must stay visible with its metadata
 *   intact, must never look playable, and must say plainly that the file has to
 *   be re-imported. It must never be silently dropped.
 *
 * Both cases start from a real import through the shipping path, so the bytes
 * really are in Cache Storage before they are taken away. Nothing in this file
 * moves audio anywhere; eviction only deletes.
